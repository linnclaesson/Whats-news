                                Sampha has recently made an exciting
                                announcement regarding his music career. The
                                London singer-songwriter took to
                                <a

                                >
                                to reveal the upcoming release of his highly
                                anticipated new album, <em>Lahai</em>. This
                                album serves as the follow-up to his successful
                                2017 project,
                                <a

                                >. Sampha explained that the title of the album,
                                Lahai, holds special significance as it is his
                                grandfather's name, which also happens to be his
                                middle name. <br /><br />
                                When the post of the announcement was made, the
                                date of the release was unknown, however, we now
                                know the official release date for Lahai is
                                October 20th. Sampha shared his enthusiasm for
                                this new musical chapter through his Instagram
                                post. He described the themes and emotions that
                                will be explored in the album, including fever
                                dreams, continuums, dancing, generations,
                                syncopation, bridges, grief, motherlands, love,
                                spirit, fear, flesh, and flight. <br /><br />
                                In addition to this exciting news, Sampha has
                                been giving fans a sneak peek into his musical
                                journey. In august he shared a
